# Type-safe elm-style decoder

The library was inspired by [Elm decoders](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Decode) and [jsonous library](https://github.com/kofno/jsonous).

## TODOs:

1. Add some decoders: maybe, nullable
2. decodeString with JSON.parse
3. Add documentation for all functions
4. Prepare and publish as a npm package
5. Check typescript settings
6. Add travisCI
7. Add some other decoders: oneOf, booleanExt, Date, phone, email, url
